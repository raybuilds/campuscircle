# Campus Circle

Campus Circle is a **mode-based survival platform** for students living away from home.  
It focuses on **daily pain points**—food quality, safety, lost items, hygiene, and sudden crises—rather than listings or brokerage.

This repository contains a **static, demo-ready v1** designed for clarity, trust, and realistic student workflows.

---

## 🧠 Core Idea

Students don’t live in “features”.  
They live in **states**.

Campus Circle is organized around **modes of student life**, not pages or listings.

---

## 🧭 Modes

### Common Mode (Home Dashboard)
For students who are undecided or settling in.

- Area & locality guidance (preview)
- Marketplace preview (books, essentials)
- Food & tiffin discovery preview
- Emergency access
- Seeded community activity

**Purpose:** Help students decide and orient themselves.

---

### Hostel Mode (Shared Living)
For students living in hostels.

- Mess feedback with **weekly trends**
- Hygiene & facilities issue tracking
- Lost & Found (preview + link)
- Collective accountability tips

**Purpose:** Make shared problems visible and harder to ignore.

---

### PG Mode (Independent Living)
For students living in PGs or rented rooms.

- Tiffin & food feedback with **reliability signals**
- Daily services (laundry, repairs, Wi-Fi)
- Lost & Found (preview + link)
- Safety-first living tips

**Purpose:** Support self-managed student living.

---

## 🛟 Safety & Crisis (Core Pillar)

### Safety & Trust Page
A dedicated, always-accessible safety hub.

Includes:
- Anti-ragging helpline (1800-180-5522)
- Women’s safety numbers (181 / 1091)
- Mental health support (Tele-MANAS 14416)
- Clear “what to do” protocols for:
  - harassment
  - theft
  - food hygiene issues

All safety content follows a **calm, repeatable micro-structure**:
- When to use
- Action
- What to say
- What happens next

---

### Crisis / Transition Mode
A **panic room**, not a browsing page.

Used for:
- Immediate danger
- Ragging or harassment
- Sudden eviction / forced move
- Emotional overload or panic

Focused on **checklists and immediate steps**, not discussion or posting.

---

## 📣 Tiny Products (v1 Depth)

### Lost & Found
A shared coordination board treated as a small product:

- Structured item cards (item, category, location, time, status)
- Status visibility: Lost / Found / Returned
- Clear recovery protocol

Linked from both Hostel and PG modes.

---

### Food Feedback
Deepened beyond star ratings:

- Weekly trend labels
- Repeated issue signals
- Participation counts
- Reliability emphasis (especially for PG tiffins)

---

## 🚨 Emergency Access

- Global **Emergency FAB** on key pages
- One-tap access to Crisis mode
- Safety links visible across modes

Designed for **high-stress, low-attention moments**.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- HTML5 (static)
- CSS (base / layout / components split)
- Vanilla JavaScript
- GitHub Pages (deployment)

No backend. No authentication. No analytics in v1.

---

## 🔒 v1 Scope Lock

### Included in v1
- Mode-based structure
- Safety & Crisis pillar
- Lost & Found
- Mess & Tiffin feedback depth
- Emergency access UX

### Explicitly NOT in v1
- User accounts / login
- Backend or database
- Anonymous forums / whisper boards
- Calculators or quizzes
- PWA service worker
- Analytics

These are **intentionally postponed**, not missing.

---

## 🎯 Product Positioning

Campus Circle is **not**:
- a hostel/PG listing site
- a real-estate platform
- a social network

It is a **survival layer** that helps students:
- decide
- cope
- respond when things go wrong

---

## 📌 Status

This is a **finished v1 static demo**, suitable for:
- concept validation
- demos and presentations
- faculty or reviewer walkthroughs

Further development should focus on **depth, not breadth**.
